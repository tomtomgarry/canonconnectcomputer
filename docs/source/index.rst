Common Reasons Why Your Canon Printer Won’t Connect to Your Computer
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you fix the problem, it’s important to understand what might be causing it. Here are the most common reasons:

- **Loose or Unstable USB/Wi-Fi Connections:**

Faulty or poorly connected cables or unstable wireless connections can prevent your computer from detecting the printer.

- **Outdated or Corrupt Printer Drivers:**

Drivers are essential for communication between your printer and computer. Outdated, missing, or corrupt drivers often lead to connection failures.

- **Incorrect Printer Settings:**

If your Canon printer isn’t set as the default printer or is paused/offline, print jobs won’t be processed.

- **Network Issues:**

For Wi-Fi printers, both the computer and printer must be on the same network. A weak or unstable Wi-Fi connection can disrupt the link.

- **Software or Firmware Errors:**

Temporary software glitches on either the printer or computer can prevent successful connection.
